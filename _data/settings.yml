# Experience Section

experience-title: Research Experience
experience:
- {company-name: A paper on Knowledge Graph submitted to NeurIPS 2021, duration: 2019.11 - 2021.2, job-position: Research Assistant, description: I started to work on this research project in Professor Jie Tang's KEG Lab of THU in the summer of 2020. We develop a self-supervised entity alignment algorithm to automatically align entities without training labels. The experiments on two widely-used benchmarks DWY100K and DBP15K show that our model is able to beat all previous semi-supervised alignment methods and most of the supervised alignment methods. Our discovery indicates a huge potential to get rid of supervision in the entity alignment problem, and more studies are expected for a deeper understanding of self-supervised learning. I did almost all the programming work in this project, and I am the first author of this paper. This work has been submit it to NeurIPS 2021.}

- {company-name: A Student Research Training (SRT) on the vulnerabilities of blockchain, duration: 2020.11 - 2021.3, job-position: SRT student, description: This SRT is under the guidance of Professor Zhixuan Fang, Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Science, THU. The score he gave me for this SRT is A, and we already have some results for further research.}

- {company-name: Online overseas research with Professor Dawn Song, duration: 2021.3 - 2021.10, job-position: Research Assistant, description: We have submitted a paper on knowledge extraction with pretrained language models to EMNLP 2021. We are working on a project aiming at submitting the work to ICLR 2021.}

# Education Section

education-title: Education
education:
- {degree: Mechanical Engineering (undergraduate, adjusted), years: 2017.9 - 2019.6, organization: Tsinghua University, description: "In September 2018, after one year of seeking, I found my great passion and interest in Computer Science. Although I had no CS knowledge before college, I worked very hard and was recognized by professors, and finally changed my major to CS successfully."}

- {degree: Computer Science and Technology (undergraduate, major), years: 2019.6 - 2022.7, organization: Tsinghua University, description: "I did well in most of the major courses in CS. I tried my best in every capstone project, and the professors, as well as I, are satisfied with them. A good grade should not be the ultimate goal. The most important thing is to really master knowledge and skills, be inspired, and have a strong anti-frustration ability."}

- {degree: "Statistics (undergraduate, minor)", years: 2018.9 - 2022.7, organization: Tsinghua University, description: "Minoring in Statistics can improve my ability in mathematics, data mining, and machine learning theory. I also like the different way of thinking in Statistics from CS. I was admitted into the Statistics Minor Program via exams and have made continuous progress during my learning process."}
